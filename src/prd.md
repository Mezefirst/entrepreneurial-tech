- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent patterns that create predictable interface
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional academic presentation with technology focus

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements

## GitHub Integration Implementation

### Connection Process
1. **Username Input**: Simple form for GitHub username entry
2. **Repository Fetching**: API call to GitHub to fetch user's public repositories
3. **Smart Selection**: Algorithm scores repositories based on:
   - Stars count (weight: 2x)
   - Forks count (weight: 1.5x)
   - Has description (weight: +10 points)
   - Topic tags count (weight: 3x per tag)
4. **Auto-Display**: Top 6 repositories automatically selected and displayed

### Repository Management
- **View All**: Interface to see all fetched repositories
- **Select/Deselect**: Checkbox interface for manual curation
- **Repository Details**: Shows title, description, language, stars, forks
- **README Integration**: Fetches and displays README.md content

### Display Features
- **Live Stats**: Real-time GitHub statistics
- **Language Filtering**: Filter repositories by programming language
- **Sort Options**: Sort by name, stars, forks, or last updated
- **Search**: Text search across repository titles and descriptions

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: Graceful handling of API limitations
- **Private Repositories**: Only public repositories are fetched and displayed
- **No Repositories**: Clear messaging when no suitable repositories are found
- **Network Issues**: Error handling for connectivity problems

## Implementation Considerations
- **API Integration**: GitHub REST API v3 for repository data
- **Data Persistence**: Repository selections and preferences stored locally
